# Alex C-G 101

I'm Alex C-G - I'm the Open Source Evangelist at [Jina AI](http://www.jina.ai). This is my personal README - it's here to give you a quick overview of who I am and what I (and my department at Jina) do.

* [Medium](https://medium.com/@alexcg1)
* [Personal blog](http://alexcg1.github.io) (not updated for a while)

This README is a work in progress. I guess that's true of myself too, just like (I hope) most of humanity.

## Contact Me

- Best way: Slack or email
- Best time: late morning or early afternoon
- Meetings: Check my [Google Calendar]() and fill in an empty slot

For general dev-rel stuff, post to our dedicated Slack channel, don't ping me directly

## Developer Relations

Our department is about engaging with developers and building up our community. I break our tasks down into four key focus areas:

### Developer Advocacy

- Aim: Being Jina's ears to the developer community, and being the developer community's voice to Jina
- Tasks: Monitor Slack, discuss in-person with devs at conferences, meetups

### Developer Experience

- Aim: Provide smooth onboarding to get new users engaged with Jina and existing contributors more deeply engaged
- Tasks: Documentation, examples, testing, tutorials, etc

### Developer Evangelism

- Aim: Engage with developer community to get the word out about Jina
- Tasks: Organize events, attend events, hackathons, blog posts

### Developer Marketing

- Aim: Eh, all the other stuff that needs to be done
- Tasks: Social media, branding, influencer engagement, etc

Note the above isn't comprehensive, but just gives a broad overview.

## Other Work Stuff

- As you may have guessed from the "open source evangelist" bit, I'm into open source. I use Manjaro Linux on a Thinkpad X1, and *really* wish we had open alternatives to Zoom, Slack, etc
- I'm also a vim (okay, neovim) user. I want to integrate it into Google Docs but lack the time/smarts

## Personal Stuff

- Big fan of IPA beer, Star Trek, Doctor Who, sci-fi in general
- *Technically* homeless in that I've been on the road for so long I don't have a permanent abode (which is quite the pain in the ass during a pandemic)
- I speak/write not-completely-terrible Mandarin. Okay, so actually it's a bit *mamahuhu* (damn, I need to get Chinese input working again)
- I try to use open source in everything I do. Linux on a Thinkpad. No Macs or Windows for me if I can help it.
- Once got stuck in the Gobi Desert for 6 months
- Once starred on a Chinese reality TV show where I danced ballet. Badly. In drag.
