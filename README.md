# Alex C-G 101

I'm Alex C-G - I'm the Open Source Evangelist at [Jina AI](http://www.jina.ai). This is my personal README - it's here to give you a quick overview of who I am and how best to ~get my attention~ facilitate efficient communication.

* [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/alexcg)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexcg/)
* [Medium](https://medium.com/@alexcg1)
* [Personal blog](http://alexcg1.github.io) (not updated for a while)

This README is a work in progress. I guess that's true of myself too, just like (I hope) most of humanity.

## Why a README?

Uh, because I'm such a shy wallflower and don't like speaking to people in person...ha, as if! I'm totally a people person, but I have a LOT of meetings with folks. This is for y'all to get some background on how best to contact me and about me in general.

This is intended to be work-agnostic. So whatever $COMPANY I may be at, this thing should more-or-less apply.

In case you haven't noticed this will be kinda informal with a wee splash of everything ~just like me~.

## Contact Me

- Best way: Slack or email
- Best time: late morning or early afternoon
- Meetings: Check my calendar on $COMPANY Google account and fill in an empty slot

For general dev-rel stuff, post to our dedicated Slack channel, don't ping me directly

## Developer Relations

Our department is about engaging with developers and building up our community. I break our tasks down into four key focus areas:

Note: I'll likely break this into a dedicated dev-rel README sometime soon. Mostly because I simply can't *stand* how stuffy my language is in this section.

### Developer Advocacy

- Aim: Being $COMPANY's ears to the developer community, and being the developer community's voice to $COMPANY
- Tasks: Monitor Slack, discuss in-person with devs at conferences, meetups

### Developer Experience

- Aim: Provide smooth onboarding to get new users engaged with $PRODUCT and existing contributors more deeply engaged
- Tasks: Documentation, examples, testing, tutorials, etc

### Developer Evangelism

- Aim: Engage with developer community to get the word out about $PRODUCT
- Tasks: Organize events, attend events, hackathons, blog posts

### Developer Marketing

- Aim: Eh, all the other stuff that needs to be done
- Tasks: Social media, branding, influencer engagement, etc

Note the above isn't comprehensive, but just gives a broad overview.

## Other Work Stuff

- As you may have guessed from the "open source evangelist" bit, I'm into open source. I use Manjaro Linux on a Thinkpad X1, and *really* wish we had open alternatives to Zoom, Slack, etc

## Personal Stuff

Warning: swears ahead.

- Big fan of IPA beer, Star Trek, Doctor Who, sci-fi in general
- *Technically* homeless in that I've been on the road for so long I don't have a permanent abode (which is quite the pain in the ass during a pandemic)
- I speak/write not-completely-terrible Mandarin. Okay, so actually it's a bit *mamahuhu* (damn, I need to get Chinese input working again)
- My English is likewise fscked - I've lived in so many places I speak a mish-mash of American/British/New Zealand English. With peppering of Yiddish and other languages for shits and giggles
- Once got stuck in the Gobi Desert for 6 months
- Once starred on a Chinese reality TV show where I danced ballet. Badly. In drag.

## Misc

### General

- Diversity and inclusion all the way. I wrote a list on [diverse figures in tech history](https://github.com/folkswhocode/awesome-diversity/blob/master/FIGURES.md)
- Pronouns: he/him. I like *they* too. I try to be gender neutral when I use pronouns myself, hence all the *folks* and *peeps* in my lingo

### Tech

- Break free from your Macbooks. All you have to lose are your chains (seriously, give me a jackhammer and five minutes alone with your shiny machine)
- I'm a vim (okay, neovim) user. I want to integrate it into Google Docs but lack the time/smarts
- Markdown and plaintext are my preferred formats. Though I can hold my nose and deal with Google Docs too.

### Unpopular Opinions

Gee, wonder why I saved this section for last?

- Sports are just glorified tidying up. People putting things into other things. If I want to watch that I'll just watch my niece put blocks in holes
- Star Wars isn't sci-fi. It's fantasy
